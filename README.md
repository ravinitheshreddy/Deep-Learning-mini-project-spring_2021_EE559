# Deep-Learning-mini-project-spring_2021_EE559

This is github repository for the mini projects in EE 559 Deep Learning Course at EPFL in Spring 2021.

# Project(s) Description

The project is composed of two mini projects described below. The detailed description can be seen [here](dlc-miniprojects.pdf).

1. The objective of the first project is to test different architectures to compare two digits visible in a two-channel image. It aims at showing in particular the impact of weight sharing, and of the use of an auxiliary loss to help the training of the main objective.

2. The objective of the second project is to design a mini "deep learning framework" using only pytorch's tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or the neural-network modules.
